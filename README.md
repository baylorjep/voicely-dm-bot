# Voicely DM Bot

An AI-powered Instagram DM bot that warms leads in the creator's voice, provides deterministic quotes, and handles booking requests.

- **Supports multiple creators** with individual configurations
- **Lead-nurtures** with warm, on-brand replies in each creator's voice
- **Generates quotes** using a deterministic pricing engine (no invented prices)
- **Handles booking** requests with creator-specific CTAs
- **Hands off** complex requests to humans via Slack or logging
- **Respects Instagram limits** (24-hour window, user-initiated threads only)

## B2B Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Tenant Management

Each creator (tenant) has their own configuration stored in `config/tenants/{tenantId}.json`:

```json
{
  "creator_name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "booking_url": "https://calendly.com/sarah-photography/30min",
  "pricing_config": "./config/pricing.sample.yml",
  "voice_config": "./config/voice.sample.json",
  "persona_config": "./config/persona.sample.json",
  "meta_config": {
    "page_id": "123456789012345",
    "page_access_token": "EAAG..."
  }
}
```

### Webhook URLs

Each tenant gets their own webhook endpoint:
- **Single tenant:** `/webhook`
- **Multi-tenant:** `/webhook/{tenantId}`

Example: `/webhook/photographer_sarah`

### Creating New Tenants

```bash
# Create a new tenant
npm run create-tenant photographer_mike

# Edit the configuration
nano config/tenants/photographer_mike.json

# Set up Meta app for this tenant
# Use webhook URL: https://your-domain.com/webhook/photographer_mike
```

## Configuration

The pricing engine supports:
- **Packages:** Base services with included features
- **Addons:** Optional extras (second shooter, rush edits, etc.)
- **Rules:** Conditional fees (travel fees based on distance)

```yaml
currency: USD
packages:
  mini: { label: "Mini Session (30 min)", price: 150, includes: ["20 edited photos"] }
  standard: { label: "Standard (60 min)", price: 300, includes: ["60â€“80 shots", "Location consult"] }
  wedding_base: { label: "Wedding Base (4 hrs)", price: 1200, hours: 4, includes: ["Lead shooter", "Online gallery"] }

addons:
  second_shooter: { label: "Second shooter", price: 300 }
  extra_hour: { label: "Extra hour", price: 250 }
  rush_edit: { label: "48-hr rush edits", price: 200 }

rules:
  travel_fee:
    trigger: { distance_miles_gt: 25 }
    formula: "2 * (miles - 25)"
```

### Voice (`config/voice.sample.json`)

Configure the bot's personality and tone:

```json
{
  "tone": "warm, upbeat, concise, never salesy",
  "emoji_policy": "sparingly, 0-1 per message; favorites: âœ¨ðŸ™Œ",
  "greetings": ["Hey hey!", "Hi there!"],
  "signoffs": ["â€“ B", "â€“ Baylor"],
  "no_go_phrases": ["limited time offer", "last chance"],
  "style_examples": [
    "So pumped you reached out!",
    "Love this idea â€” happy to help."
  ]
}
```

### Persona (`config/persona.sample.json`)

Define qualification questions and booking behavior:

```json
{
  "qualification": {
    "always_ask": ["date", "location", "hours needed", "approx headcount/budget if wedding"],
    "optional": ["indoor/outdoor", "vibe/mood"]
  },
  "booking": {
    "cta": "You can grab a time here ðŸ‘‰ {{BOOKING_URL}}",
    "softener": "No rush â€” happy to answer Qs!"
  },
  "boundaries": {
    "when_to_quote": "Only quote if the user asked for price or you have date + hours or equivalent scope.",
    "handoff_if": ["out of scope", "custom multi-day", "last-minute rush with travel"]
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Run Pricing Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Test Quote Flows

See `test/quote-flows.md` for detailed conversation scenarios.

**Example test scenario:**
```
User: "Wedding photography for 6 hours with second shooter, venue is 40 miles away"
Expected: Quote with $2030 total
- Wedding Base (4 hrs): $1200
- 2 extra hours: $500  
- Second shooter: $300
- Travel fee: $30
```

### Seed Instagram Captions

Analyze your recent Instagram posts to improve voice configuration:

```bash
npm run seed
# or with merge flag to update voice config
npm run seed -- --merge
```

## Production Notes

### Rate Limiting
- Instagram has rate limits on messaging
- Bot respects 24-hour standard messaging window
- Only replies to user-initiated conversations

### Security
- HMAC signature verification is stubbed for MVP
- Implement proper signature verification for production
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

### Monitoring
- All requests are logged with unique IDs
- Handoffs are logged or sent to Slack
- Health check endpoint at `/health`

### Deployment
The app is compatible with:
- **Vercel:** Deploy as Node.js app
- **Render:** Use Node.js environment
- **Fly.io:** Deploy with Docker
- **Heroku:** Standard Node.js deployment

### Scaling Considerations
- No database for MVP (configs loaded in memory)
- Consider Redis for session storage in production
- Add request queuing for high volume
- Implement proper error handling and retries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook verification fails:**
   - Check `VERIFY_TOKEN` matches Meta app settings
   - Ensure webhook URL is accessible

2. **Messages not sending:**
   - Verify `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is valid
   - Check Instagram account is connected to Meta app
   - Ensure 24-hour messaging window hasn't expired

3. **Pricing errors:**
   - Check YAML syntax in pricing config
   - Verify package keys match in LLM prompts
   - Test pricing math with `npm test`

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=true npm run dev
```

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the test scenarios in `test/quote-flows.md`
2. Run pricing tests with `npm test`
3. Review logs for request IDs and error details
4. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
